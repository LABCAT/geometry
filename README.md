# Geometry No. 1

A generative animation exploring sacred geometry through deterministic evolution. The piece features 48 distinct states across 4 generations, with each generation containing 12 unique geometric configurations. Built with p5.js and integrated with fxhash for deterministic, shareable outputs.

## Features

- **48 States**: 12 geometric variations per generation (4 generations total)
- **Deterministic Output**: Each hash produces consistent, reproducible results
- **Evolutionary Lineage**: Generations build upon previous ones through interactive UI
- **Sacred Geometry**: Explores patterns like the Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, and geometric progressions
- **Interactive Evolution**: Click through generations to explore the geometric evolution
